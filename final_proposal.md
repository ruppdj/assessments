productsI will be analyzing and modeling data from Wasserstrom, a national restaurant supplies distribution company.  I will be using there order records from several years and distribution.  I will be looking at variance in ordering by date and customer and doing time analysis on the data.  The final goal is to create a model to predict ordering and inventory required to minimize over stock of the distribution centers.

I will be using Pandas, SciPy, sklearn, AWS, along with visualization tools to analyze the given data and create a model to predict future orders.

My presentation will use slides showing the information I found while looking at the data and future predictions.

I am still waiting on the rest of the data I have requested but am working on the data I already have.  I am trying to create a pipe line of sorts to use as I get more data to find the customers that cause the most variance outlier weeks signaling normal up ticks in sales and fitting predictive models.

I plan to also add weather data to the data to see/ model how weather affects the sales of repeat products. This will include the assumption that time of year and change of the seasons plays a large role in consumer behavior.


(if vendors have different order standards look to see if products with high variance also have same vendors so we can look at being able to keep lower stock if they have quicker turnaround time.  will work for items as well)
