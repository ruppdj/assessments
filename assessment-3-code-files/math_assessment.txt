** Probability **

1. The bias of a coin is 0.6 in favor of heads. What is the probability of flipping
8 or more heads in 10 flips?

10c8 (.6)^8(.4)^2 + 10c9 (.6)^9(.4)) + (.6)^10


2. You've found a secret admirer note on your desk, and don't know
who it might've come from but you know it must've been one of your
three office mates:  Jack, John, or Jimmy.
- As of yesterday, you thought it was twice as likely that Jimmy had a crush on you than John,
and that John and Jack were equally likely to have a crush on you.
- However even if Jimmy liked you, you think there'd only be 5% he'd leave you a note.
- On the other hand, if Jack liked you there'd be a whopping 50% chance he'd leave you a note.
and if John liked you, there'd be a 20% chance he'd leave you a note.

What's the probability that the note came from John?

.2*.25/(.2*.25+.05*.5+.25*.5)=.25

** Statistics **

Below are the total number of log-ins for 20 different randomly selected users from 2014:
    [10, 25, 12, 35, 14, 18, 16, 15, 22, 10, 9, 11, 49, 20, 15, 9, 18, 19, 20, 20]

3. What is the sample mean?
18.350000000000001

4. What is the sample variance?
91.502631578947373 (with ddof =1)

5. If we randomly select another user from 2014, what is the probability that he/she
has more than 15 log-ins?



6. Sales targets weren't met last year.  The sales department asserts that on average,
there were only 10 log-ins per user, however the web team thinks there were more.
Set up a frequentist hypothesis test and compute a p-value based on your data.
Ho = mu<=10
Ha = mu>10

19 degrees of freedom
t score = (10 - mean)/(s/sqrt(n)) = -3.9037741247726232
t value = .000481


7. A major charity organization is interested to see if changing the mission
statement on the website increases donations. As a pilot study, they randomly
show 1 of 10 newly drawn up mission statements to each user that comes to the site.
As such, you set up 10 separate hypothesis tests, each testing whether or not
there was an increase in donations. What adjustments would you make to account for the 10 tests?

You will have to adjust your threshold/alpha (alpha/10)


**  Modeling **

8.  Generally, when we increase the flexiblity or complexity of the model, what happens to bias?  What about variance?
What do we expect to happen to the training error?  What about the test error?

As complexity increases our bias will decrease as our variance increases.
Our training error will decrease as we approach overfitting the model but our testing error will increase.


9.  You have two models:
Model 1:   Salary ~ Occupation + Height + Gender
Model 2:   Salary ~ Occupation + Region + Height + Gender

Name 2 appropriate ways to compare these two models.
Name 1 inappropriate way to compare these two models.

test them against a data set you split into model data and test data and see how the rmse compare. Or better do a k-fold test and do use the cross val score.

Do a regression fit to them and compare R^2 using same data for fit and test.
